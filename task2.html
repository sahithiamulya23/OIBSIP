                Mahendra Singh Dhoni (commonly known as M. S. Dhoni) is an Indian cricketer who captained the Indian team in
                limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2016 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. An attacking right-handed
                middle-order
                batsman and wicket-keeper, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest finishers in limited-overs cricket. He made
                his
                One Day International (ODI) debut in December 2004 against Bangladesh, and played his first Test a year later
                against
                Sri Lanka.
            
                Dhoni's coolness and ability to back players under immense pressure is to the fore in Bangalore, where Bangladesh
                are
                beaten by one run during the World Twenty20. Dhoni helps India pull off an incredible heist.
